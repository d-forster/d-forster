Hi, I'm Decl√°n!

I'm a math teacher in the UK with an interest in data science and machine learning, looking to build up a portfolio with a view towards a potential career change.

I did my Master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Warwick and as such currently have no CS-based qualifications. However, hopefully the projects I upload here will show that I am a motivated coder and problem-solver at heart.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
